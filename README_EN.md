## 🎨 What Is Easel?

Easel is an open-source content workspace for social media creators. It connects an OpenClaw Agent, account profiles, content Skills, and real media tools, enabling the Agent to produce and archive content instead of merely explaining what to do, with direct or on-demand publishing when needed.

Think of Easel as a content partner that remembers your positioning, audience, voice, platform constraints, preferences, and past performance. It stays with you from trend discovery through publishing, then carries what it learns into the next creation cycle.

Easel promotional demo:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dd060dc-53dd-4bb2-99a3-e65ab6f65166

Easel follows five connected workflows: **Discover** relevant trends and opportunities, **Plan** topics, hooks, scripts, and schedules, **Produce** text, audio, and video, **Publish** checked and platform-ready content directly to the appropriate platforms, and **Attribute** performance insights back to the account profile.

#### 📌 Usage Notes and Research Vision

> - **Use the Web workspace for the complete experience:** it includes conversations, assets, accounts, profiles, a content library, and publishing management beyond the CLI entry points, and it is our recommended way to use Easel; for terminal-only display quirks, see [Known Issues](docs/known-issues_EN.md).
> - **Be cautious with automated Xiaohongshu publishing:** automation may trigger verification, reach restrictions, or account risk. Use preview and preflight checks, and prefer human-confirmed publishing.
> - **Research applied to real life:** Easel brings our research into real social media workflows. We will continue exploring social intelligence for AI in social media, including a deeper understanding of creators, audiences, and authentic interaction.

## ✨ Why Easel?

- **One Agent across the entire workflow:** discover trends, evaluate topics, plan calendars, generate copy and visuals, produce video, publish, and analyze results in one continuous flow.
- **Profile-driven creation:** each account has its own positioning, style, audience, platforms, preferences, boundaries, and long-term memory.
- **Executable Skills:** image, card, voice-over, subtitle, editing, short-drama, and publishing Skills include runnable tools and save deliverables to `outputs/`.
- **One source, many platforms:** adapt a single idea into Xiaohongshu cards, short video, a Zhihu article, or a short post while respecting platform conventions.
- **Project-based outputs:** source material, intermediate files, metadata, and final deliverables stay together for revision, retrying, and publishing.
- **A publishing and learning loop:** Easel supports login, adaptation, and publishing workflows for Xiaohongshu, Douyin, Kuaishou, Zhihu, Bilibili, WeChat Channels, and WeChat Official Accounts, with performance data feeding back into account profiles.

## 🧭 Five-Layer Content Workflow

1. **Discover:** aggregate trending topics, industry news, competitors, and user conversations to identify relevant opportunities.
2. **Plan:** turn opportunities into topics, titles, scripts, content series, and calendar entries.
3. **Produce:** create copy, cards, posters, infographics, audio, video, short dramas, and paper explainers.
4. **Publish:** adapt titles, copy, aspect ratios, and media for each platform, run preflight checks, and publish through logged-in accounts.
5. **Attribute:** collect views, engagement, comments, and content performance, then preserve useful patterns in the account profile.

## 🧰 Implemented Capabilities

| Layer | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **Discover** | Cross-platform trends, vertical research, content-gap analysis, event calendars, algorithm updates, competitor research, industry news, platform differences, RSS aggregation, and UGC discovery |
| **Plan** | Positioning, audience profiles, persona and voice, account diagnosis, content matrices, topic scoring, trend adaptation, series planning, hooks, outlines, storyboards, calendars, repurposing, livestreams, campaigns, and collaborations |

## 🚀 Quick Start

Requirements: Linux or macOS, Python 3.10+, and Git. The installer checks Node.js 22.19+, FFmpeg, and Playwright/Chromium, and provides a platform-specific guide when Node.js is missing.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ZJU-REAL/Easel.git
cd Easel
bash setup.sh
source .venv/bin/activate    # easel is installed in .venv; activate it first (Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate)
easel web
# Or: easel chat
```

> If you see `easel: command not found`, the virtual environment is not activated. You can also run it by full path without activating, e.g. `.venv/bin/easel doctor` (Windows: `.venv\Scripts\easel.exe doctor`).

`bash setup.sh` is a rerunnable guided installer. It detects and reuses an existing local OpenClaw
installation without touching `~/.openclaw/`; Easel uses its isolated `~/.openclaw-easel/` profile.
When an existing OpenClaw default model is found, the installer asks whether to reuse its model name.
If no model is configured, it interactively asks for an Anthropic API key and model name. You may also
copy `.env.example` and fill it in before running the installer.

Open `http://localhost:7860` for the Web workspace. Run `easel doctor` to check the environment and `easel ping` to verify the gateway and Agent connection.

The installer installs the Python dependencies required by the Web UI, media processing, and browser publishing:

```bash
pip install -e .
python -m playwright install chromium
# FFmpeg is also required on the system.
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The minimum configuration is a usable LLM in the project-root `.env` file:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLAUDE_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
```

### Use your local Claude Code login (no API key)

If you already use Claude Code, the agent can reuse its login through OpenClaw's `claude-cli` runtime instead of an API key; usage counts against your Claude subscription. Add one line to `.env` and edit the existing `CLAUDE_MODEL` line to the model you want (it must be `anthropic/<model>`):

```dotenv
# Explicit choice; wins over any API key in .env
EASEL_AGENT_RUNTIME=claude-cli
# Edit the existing line rather than adding a second one; the template's anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 also works on this route
CLAUDE_MODEL=anthropic/claude-opus-5
# Optional: defaults to ~/.claude-easel; "shared" reuses your personal ~/.claude
# EASEL_CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=
```

The setup wizard only appears while `.env` has no usable key; its option 4 appends `EASEL_AGENT_RUNTIME=claude-cli` and `CLAUDE_MODEL=anthropic/claude-opus-5` (you can change the model). By default the agent gets its own Claude Code config dir, `~/.claude-easel`: sharing your personal `~/.claude` would pull its plugins, hooks and `CLAUDE.md` into the agent's replies. Log that dir in once with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-easel claude auth login` (an interactive `bash setup.sh` walks you through it). After changing the dir, rerun `bash setup.sh`; it restarts the gateway, and existing conversations need `/reset` or a new session. Only `setup.sh` (Linux/macOS) supports this route for now.

`.env.example` also documents optional video, music, voice, and Anthropic-compatible provider settings. Configure only the capabilities you use. Missing media-provider credentials do not prevent chat, planning, or text creation.

| Capability | Configuration | Additional dependency |
|---|---|---|
| AI video | `VIDEO_PROVIDER` plus the provider key, URL, and model | A supported video service |
| AI music | `MUSIC_PROVIDER` plus provider settings | A supported music service |
| Cloud voice | `VOICE_PROVIDER` plus provider settings | A supported voice service |
| Local media processing | No model is required for supported local tools | FFmpeg |
| Browser publishing | Log in from the Web workspace's Accounts page | Playwright Chromium and valid platform accounts |

Never commit `.env`, cookies, or platform login state. Real publishing can be affected by verification, permissions, platform risk controls, and UI changes; use previews and checks for the first attempt.

## 🧩 Using Easel

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `easel web [--port 7860]` | Start the Web workspace |
| `easel chat` | Start a multi-turn terminal conversation and select an account profile |
| `easel skill <name> -i "..." [-p <profile>]` | Run a Skill directly; input may also be a file path |
| `easel doctor` | Check Python, Node.js, OpenClaw, and essential configuration |
| `easel ping` | Check the gateway and Agent connection |
| `easel gateway start\|stop\|restart\|status\|logs` | Manage the OpenClaw gateway |

```bash
easel skill quality-gate -i "Review this social media post"
easel skill social-content -i "Write a post introducing spatial intelligence"
easel skill quality-gate -i "Review this draft" -p MyCreatorProfile
```

## 🧬 Account Profiles

Each profile is stored under `profiles/<name>/` and contains six dimensions: identity, style, audience, platforms, preferences and boundaries, and long-term memory.

```bash
cp -r profiles/_template "profiles/MyCreatorProfile"
```

Profiles can also be created and edited from the Web workspace.

```

Easel uses an isolated `easel` OpenClaw profile and does not overwrite an existing OpenClaw setup. The Web workspace defaults to port `7860`; the gateway port is chosen by OpenClaw (non-default profiles get a hashed port — `easel` → `37289`, not `18789`) and is resolved automatically by Easel.
